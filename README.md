# Math560_Project
This repository is for my Spring 2022 semester project in Math 560 (Statistical Data Analysis) at the University of Louisville. The project goal is to analyze a data set of stats from the popular Nintendo game series, Pok√©mon. The data was obtained from Kaggle.com, and the .csv file is stored in this repository. Alternatively, you can access the data set via this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abcsds/pokemon
